<h1>Note App</h1>

In this aplication you can enable the speech feature so the audio is converted to text and automatically fulfills the textbox for you, or you can also write a text note as usual.

The speech recognition feature was implemented with Web Speech API.

The stylization and responsiviness was made with “Tailwind”, so the application’s layout adjusts to any device.

All the notes created are kept in Local Storage. You can also search for a specific note in the “search bar”.

Dependencies:
 - Vite
 - React

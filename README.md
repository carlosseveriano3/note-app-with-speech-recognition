<h1>Note App</h1>

This is a note app created with React, in which you can write a note as usual, or speak so the audio is converted to text and automatically fulfills the textbox.

The api used for the speech recognition is from the web itself. The only thing needed is to give permission to the browser to use your mic.

The stylization and responsiviness was made with “Tailwind”, so the application’s layout adjusts to any device.

All the notes created are kept in Local Storage. You can also search for a specific note in the “search bar”.

Dependencies:
 - Vite
 - React
